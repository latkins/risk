the list of the available stats is a bit off to the left. is this bad? should i change this? at one point i was convinced i like it.

the connectedness of delete button and asset list should be changed to MD (or the asset name)?

when pressing ENTER after entering a quantity for stocks, weird shit like reloading occurs. why?

the quantities are somehow disjoint from the asset name when creating the list of assets in a portfolio. this is a functionality flaw we need to fix.
